# YouTube Player Flutter Fixed

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/youtube_player_flutter_fixed.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/youtube_player_flutter_fixed)

Flutter plugin for playing or streaming YouTube videos inline using the official [**iFrame Player API**](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference).

## 🆕 What's Fixed
This package fixes iOS crashes that occurred with the original `youtube_player_flutter` package by replacing `flutter_inappwebview` with the more stable `zikzak_inappwebview`.

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Fixed iOS app crashes in latest iOS versions
- ✅ Uses `zikzak_inappwebview` instead of `flutter_inappwebview`
- ✅ Maintains all original functionality
- ✅ Better stability on iOS devices

Supported Platforms:
* **Android** 
* **iOS**
For web support, use [youtube_player_iframe](https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_player_iframe). In future, this package will extend youtube_player_iframe.

## Salient Features
* Inline Playback
* Supports captions
* No need for API Key
* Supports custom controls
* Retrieves video meta data
* Supports Live Stream videos
* Supports changing playback rate
* Support for both Android and iOS
* Adapts to quality as per the bandwidth
* Fast Forward and Rewind on horizontal drag
* Fit Videos to wide screens with pinch gestures

The plugin uses [zikzak_inappwebview](https://pub.dev/packages/zikzak_inappwebview) under-the-hood, which provides better stability and fixes iOS crashes that occurred with the original flutter_inappwebview.

Since *zikzak_inappwebview* relies on Flutter's mechanism for embedding Android and iOS views, this plugin might share some known issues tagged with the [platform-views](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/labels/a%3A%20platform-views) label.

## Requirements
* Android: `minSdkVersion 17` and add support for `androidx` (see [AndroidX Migration](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/androidx-migration))
* iOS: `--ios-language swift`, Xcode version `>= 11`

## Setup

### iOS
No Configuration Needed

For more info, [see here](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview#important-note-for-ios)

### Android
Set `minSdkVersion` of your `android/app/build.gradle` file to at least 17.

For more info, [see here](https://pub.dev/packages/zikzak_inappwebview#important-note-for-android)

*Note:* Although the minimum to be set is 17, the player won't play on device with API < 20 (19 if Hybrid Composition is enabled). 
For API < 20 devices, you might want to forward the video to be played using YouTube app instead, using packages like `url_launcher` or `android_intent`.

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  youtube_player_flutter_fixed: ^1.0.1
```

Then run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

And import it:
```dart
import 'package:youtube_player_flutter_fixed/youtube_player_flutter_fixed.dart';
```

## Usage

#### Using Youtube Player
         
```dart
YoutubePlayerController _controller = YoutubePlayerController(
    initialVideoId: 'iLnmTe5Q2Qw',
    flags: YoutubePlayerFlags(
        autoPlay: true,
        mute: true,
    ),
);

YoutubePlayer(
    controller: _controller,
    showVideoProgressIndicator: true,
    progressIndicatorColor: Colors.amber,
    progressColors: const ProgressBarColors(
      playedColor: Colors.amber,
      handleColor: Colors.amberAccent,
    ),
    onReady: () {
      _controller.addListener(listener);
    },
),
```

#### For FullScreen Support
If fullscreen support is required, wrap your player with `YoutubePlayerBuilder`

```dart
YoutubePlayerBuilder(
    player: YoutubePlayer(
        controller: _controller,
    ),
    builder: (context, player){
        return Column(
            children: [
                // some widgets
                player,
                //some other widgets
            ],
        );
    ),
),
```

         
#### Playing live stream videos
Set the isLive property to true in order to change the UI to match Live Video.

![Live UI Demo](misc/live_ui.png) 

```dart
YoutubePlayerController _controller = YoutubePlayerController(
    initialVideoId: 'iLnmTe5Q2Qw',
    flags: YoutubePLayerFlags(
      isLive: true,
    ),
);

YoutubePlayer(
    controller: _controller,
    liveUIColor: Colors.amber,
),
```

## Want to customize the player?
 With v5.x.x and up, use the `topActions` and `bottomActions` properties to customize the player.

 Some of the widgets bundled with the plugin are:
 * FullScreenButton
 * RemainingDuration
 * CurrentPosition
 * PlayPauseButton
 * PlaybackSpeedButton
 * ProgressBar

```dart
YoutubePlayer(
    controller: _controller,
    bottomActions: [
      CurrentPosition(),
      ProgressBar(isExpanded: true),
      TotalDuration(),
    ],
),
```

## Want to play using Youtube URLs ? 
The plugin also provides `convertUrlToId()` method that converts youtube links to its corresponding video ids.
```dart
String videoId;
videoId = YoutubePlayer.convertUrlToId("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBAyRBTfsOU");
print(videoId); // BBAyRBTfsOU
```
