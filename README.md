This package uses [webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) under-the-hood.

## Setup
See [**webview_flutter**'s doc](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) for the requirements.

### Using the player
Start by creating a controller.

```dart
final _controller = YoutubePlayerController(
  params: YoutubePlayerParams(
    mute: false,
    showControls: true,
    showFullscreenButton: true,
  ),
);

_controller.loadVideoById(...); // Auto Play
_controller.cueVideoById(...); // Manual Play
_controller.loadPlaylist(...); // Auto Play with playlist
_controller.cuePlaylist(...); // Manual Play with playlist

// If the requirement is just to play a single video.
final _controller = YoutubePlayerController.fromVideoId(
  videoId: '<video-id>',
  autoPlay: false,
  params: const YoutubePlayerParams(showFullscreenButton: true),
);
```

Then the player can be used in two ways:

#### Using `YoutubePlayer`
This widget can be used when fullscreen support is not required.

```dart
YoutubePlayer(
  controller: _controller,
  aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
);

```

#### Using `YoutubePlayerScaffold`
This widget can be used when fullscreen support for the player is required.

```dart
YoutubePlayerScaffold(
  controller: _controller,
  aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
  builder: (context, player) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        player,
        Text('Youtube Player'),
      ],
    );
  },
)
```

See the [example app](example/lib/main.dart) for detailed usage.

## Inherit the controller to descendant widgets
The package provides `YoutubePlayerControllerProvider`.

```dart
YoutubePlayerControllerProvider(
  controller: _controller,
  child: Builder(
    builder: (context){
      // Access the controller as: 
      // `YoutubePlayerControllerProvider.of(context)` 
      // or `controller.ytController`.
    },
  ),
);
```

## Want to customize the player?
The package provides `YoutubeValueBuilder`, which can be used to create any custom controls.

For example, let's create a custom play pause button.
```dart
YoutubeValueBuilder(
   controller: _controller, // This can be omitted, if using `YoutubePlayerControllerProvider`
   builder: (context, value) {
      return IconButton(
         icon: Icon( 
           value.playerState == PlayerState.playing
             ? Icons.pause
             : Icons.play_arrow,
         ),
         onPressed: value.isReady
            ? () {
              value.playerState == PlayerState.playing
                ? context.ytController.pause()
                : context.ytController.play();
              }
            : null,
      );
   },
);
```
